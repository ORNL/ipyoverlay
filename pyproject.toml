# W0613: unused-argument
# W0511: fixme  (it's okay for some todos to stick around)
# W0223: abstract-method (tentatively disabling this, complaining about no copy/deepcopy on widget classes
# C0103: invalid-name (it doesn't like 'df', but this is convention.)
# E1120: no-value-for-parameter (curifactory stages expect not passing function arguments.)
# I1101: c-extension-no-member (don't penalize not having python source?)
# R0903: too-few-public-methods (what a BS complaint.)
# R0914: too-many-locals (I disagree that this is a useful measure of complexity.
# R1735: use-dict-literal (strongly disagree, I prefer dict(some="thing") to {"some": "thing"}
# R0901: too-many-ancestors (can't help it, have to extend widget which has a long chain)
# R0902: too-many-instance-attributes (vuetify widgets use attributes to comm to js, this is required)
# R0913: too-many-arguments (look, parameterization has to occur _somewhere_.)
